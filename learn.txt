According to me, DevClub is a group of talented and curious technology enthusiasts 
and are specialised in finding solutions oriented with software development in order
to make life easier and fun around them. They even ignite creativity, innovation and passion.
These are cool nerds who sit with their laptops creating awesome hacks(:p).
They inspect elements substantial(you get the reference) for developing softwares.
